In 2010 I completed a bachelor's degree in History at the University of Iowa and moved to Japan to explore my interest in Japanese history and culture. I lived in Tokyo for eight years, where I taught English, earned a master's degree in Japanese Studies, and worked as a Japanese-English translator.
Outside of my language translation work, I continued to take online courses in a variety of unfamiliar topics, and eventually became aware of the rapid progress being made in the fields of machine learning and predictive genomics, which inspired me to reorient my career path. In 2018 I moved back to Iowa City to enroll in an informatics master's program, focusing on bioinformatics and computational biology.
I completed my bioinformatics master's degree in May of 2020, after which I found employment with a Japanese IT company in Tokyo. Over the past year I have expanded my skill stack by creating database applications, setting up Linux systems, and managing resources on cloud platforms.
I'm currently looking for a position on a data science, data analysis, and machine learning project where I can fully leverage the programming and statistical analysis knowledge I acquired in my bioinformatics master's program.
