Passionate about utilizing and developing statistical software to provide quantitative insights into complex questions. Broad knowledge base in a variety of fields including genomics, languages, informatics, data science, and natural language processing. Well-versed in many programming languages, statistical analysis tools, and cloud platforms.

I am primarily interested in applying computing to genetic and linguistic research ventures, but would also be excited to expand my horizons into new subject areas. There is always more to discover.

I'm currently looking to collaborate on data science, data analysis, and machine learning projects where I can fully leverage the programming and statistical analysis skills I acquired in my bioinformatics master's program.
