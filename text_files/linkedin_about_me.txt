Passionate about utilizing and developing statistical software to provide quantitative insights into complex questions. Broad array of skills in a variety of fields including genomics, languages, informatics, data science, and natural language processing. Extensive knowledge of programming languages, statistical analysis tools, and cloud platforms.

I am primarily interested in applying computing to genetic and linguistic research ventures, but am also excited to test myself and expand my horizons by exploring new subject areas.

I'm currently looking to collaborate on data science, data analysis, and machine learning projects where I can fully leverage the programming and statistical analysis skillset I acquired in my bioinformatics master's program.
