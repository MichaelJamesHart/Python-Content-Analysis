# Python-Content-Analysis
A simple script to analyze the content of text documents.

This program opens a text document and provides the following information:
1) The total character count.
2) The total word count.
3) The 20 most common words, *including* stop words.
4) The 20 most common words, *excluding* stop words.

This program can be used as part of a large project to quantitatively analyze the topic or sentiment of a document,
or for something simpler such as making sure you don't overuse a particular adjective in a cover letter, research paper,
or any other important body of text.
